    },
    { 
      question: "What makes this tool different from others like translateimages.com?", 
      answer: "Key advantages include: 1. **No Re-uploads for Corrections:** Our '框选补漏' (Box selection for missed areas) feature uses coordinate transfer, not image re-uploads. 2. **Professional Text Editor:** Rich styling (font, size, color), free text dragging, and batch operations. 3. **Versatile Export:** Get your work as printable PDFs, structured JSON, or layered JPGs. 4. **Smart State Persistence:** Recover your work after refreshes and easily identify OCR problem areas."
    },
    { 
      question: "What languages are supported for OCR and translation?", 
      answer: "The current backend scripts primarily support English and Chinese for OCR. The translation capabilities will depend on the specific translation engine integrated. We aim to support a wide range of languages." 
    },
    { 
      question: "What file formats can I upload for translation?", 
      answer: "For the MVP, we are focusing on standard image formats like JPG, PNG, and WEBP. Future enhancements may include direct PDF image processing." 
    },
    { 
      question: "What are the export options and their benefits?", 
      answer: "1. **Printable PDF:** High-quality PDF suitable for printing, preserving layout and text clarity. 2. **Structured JSON:** Contains all text segments, their positions, styles, and translations – ideal for programmatic use or re-importing. 3. **Layered JPG (Conceptual):** A high-quality JPG with text visually embedded. (Actual layers depend on final implementation; may be flattened)."
    },
    {
      question: "How does the '70% AI + 30% Manual' philosophy work?",
      answer: "The AI provides a strong foundation by performing OCR, layout analysis, and initial translation. This gets you about 70% of the way. The remaining 30% is where you, the user, apply your expertise using our intuitive editing tools to refine text, adjust layout, and ensure contextual accuracy, leading to a 100% perfect result."
    },
    {
      question: "Is there a free trial for paid plans?",
      answer: "Yes, all our paid plans (e.g., Pro) typically come with a 7-day free trial so you can experience the full power of the tool before committing."
